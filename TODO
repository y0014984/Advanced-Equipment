1. Text position of Read / Write / Execute permissions checkbox is misaligned / cutoff behind the checkbox
2. Likewise, 'Apply Changes' is behind the 'owner' text box
3. 'Rename' option simply renames the file to 'true' without asking anything from zeus. There should be a text box display to type the new 'rename' function
4. When clicking 'Move' its always reported as 'Invalid Path' even without asking where to move the file to. There should be a box asking where the new file/folder should be moved to. If the zeus is trying to move a folder, all the files inside the folder must move as well.
